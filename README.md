# About Me
Iâ€™m an aspiring data analyst. I've had various jobs in different industries, mostly focusing on sales for the past 6 years. 
Each year, I've been studying how things like market trends impact sales, which has helped me get better at analyzing information. 
After serious self-reflection, I started to consider becoming a data analyst. I chose this industry because I have a passion for data analysis and have completed a Boot Camp Certificate in Data Analytics & Visualization from UT Austin's McCombs School. 
I believe the skills I have gained are valuable for this new role. I want to continue honing those skills.
